\section{Professional Summary}
Experienced Applied Scientist with a background in finance and tech
industries, having worked at Rivos, Amazon, Morgan Stanley and
Olacabs. During my tenure as a software developer in India, I was
highly interested in types and property based testing. Pursuing this
passion, I earned a PhD in formal methods, equipping myself with tools
and techniques required to ensure software reliability and
correctness. I am now eager to leverage my academic expertise and
industry experience to implement formal methods in practical
applications, driving innovation and enhancing software quality in
real-world projects.

\section{Education}
